Hello! I am a fourth year student at the University of California, San Diego with a Major in Business Economics and a Minor in Engineering Mechanics. I am interested in exploring the fields of engineering and business within the aerospace or technology industries. I hope to find a career that balances quantitative and qualitative skills and requires constant interaction with people. I not only enjoy learning new technical methods of analysis, but also learning how to interpret and present data through language. I currently help manage a family-owned laundromat in Los Angeles where I book-keep finances, assist customers, and maintain machines.
