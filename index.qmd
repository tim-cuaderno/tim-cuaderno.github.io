Hello! I am an incoming Industrial and Systems Engineering graduate student at the University of Southern California. I have recently completed my undergraduate degree at the University of California, San Diego with a Major in Business Economics and a Minor in Engineering Mechanics. I am interested in exploring the fields of economics, engineering, and business within the aerospace or technology industries. I hope to find a career that balances quantitative and qualitative skills and requires constant interaction with people. I not only enjoy learning new technical methods of analysis, but also learning how to interpret and present data through language. I currently help manage a family-owned laundromat in Los Angeles where I book-keep finances, assist customers, and maintain machines. I am also a Brand Representative for Abercrombie and Fitch Co. where I provide customers with personalized styling advice, handle inventory management, and design store layout.
